* Introduction

A module to sentiment-score texts using the [[http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/lexicons/subj_lexicon/MPQA][MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon]].

* Tasks

** DONE Token modifiers should be pasted to field names.
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-05-14 Tue 12:37]

** DONE integrate with NLP.Email 
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-05-14 Tue 15:36]
** DONE tokenize for object
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-05-15 Wed 11:18]
   - does the token come after a second person object?

** DONE functions to display sample of messages
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-05-16 Thu 11:56]
   - random sample.
   - distribution of variables
   - max of specified variables.

** DONE pos tagging
   :LOGBOOK:
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-05-23 Thu 11:35]
   :END:
   - use
     [[http://nlpwp.org/book/chap-tagging.xhtml#sec-tagging-frequency]]

** TODO decide on order of tokenize and tokenize' in mpqa
   - tokenize messes up the original order, because it concatenates a
     bunch of tokenizers. at the same time, the pos tagging needs the
     original sequence of tokens because it uses that context. So,
     pos tagging should come before what I know call tokenize (the
     tokenize function), which is actually "apply modifiers" or
     something like that. so the order should be: 
     - 0) split into words
	   (ie, what actually is tokenize, keeping punctuation, )
     - 1) pos tag
     - 2) apply modifiers
     - 3) match against lexicon 

** TODO measuring deliberation
   - start here: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/showciting;jsessionid=8BB474BDB90C9E9F3DBD8D1060565A91?cid=11533353
   - also: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.182.2569
** TODO [#B] parametrize the modify assignment in tokenizeBy
    - now it always assigns the modifier to tokens after the
      predicate, but this could be a function; that would allow
      modifiers to come before the predicate etc.

** TODO [#B] support configuration file.
   - lexiconFile, emailDir at least.
