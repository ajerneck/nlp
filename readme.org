* Introduction

A module to sentiment-score texts using the [[http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/lexicons/subj_lexicon/MPQA][MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon]].

* Tasks

** DONE Token modifiers should be pasted to field names.
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-05-14 Tue 12:37]

** DONE integrate with NLP.Email 
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-05-14 Tue 15:36]
** DONE tokenize for object
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2013-05-15 Wed 11:18]
   - does the token come after a second person object?

** TODO functions to display sample of messages
   - random sample.
   - distribution of variables
   - max of specified variables.

** TODO [#B] parametrize the modify assignment in tokenizeBy
    - now it always assigns the modifier to tokens after the
      predicate, but this could be a function; that would allow
      modifiers to come before the predicate etc.

** TODO [#B] support configuration file.
   - lexiconFile, emailDir at least.
